/**
 * You can use the publish and subscribe methods to broadcast messages through to the end points of the architecture.
 * The majority of the work is done in the devtoolsPanel and the AuraInspectorInjectedScript. So you'll usually want
 * to communicate between those two layers.
 *
 *
 * The layers go like this.
 * devtoolsPanel <- background <- contentScript <-> AuraInspectorInjectedScript
 *      |------------------------------------------------------^
 *
 * The messages you can publish and subscribe to are
 *
 * AuraInspector:OnAuraInitialized              $A is available and we are just about to run $A.initAsync
 * AuraInspector:OnPanelConnect                 The Aura Panel has been loaded and initialized. (Where we start the instrumentation of the app.)
 * AuraInspector:OnBootstrapEnd                 We've instrumented Aura, and now the Dev Tools can initialize and expect it to be there.
 * AuraInspector:OnContextMenu                  User Selected the "Inspect Aura Component" option in the context menu. Handled in the inspected script. Does not contain the information on what they clicked on.
 * AuraInspector:OnHighlightComponent           We focused over a component in the ComponentTree or ComponentView and the accompanying HTML element in the DOM should be spotlighted.
 * AuraInspector:OnHighlightComponentEnd        We have stopped focusing on the component, and now remove the dom element spotlight.
 * AuraInspector:AddPanel                       Add the panel at the specified URL as an Iframe tab.
 * AuraInspector:ConsoleLog                     [DEPRECATED] Show a message in the DevTools console.
 * AuraInspector:OnEventStart                   An Aura event is about to fire. Allows us to track that everything between the start and end happend as a result of this event.
 * AuraInspector:OnEventEnd                     An Aura event fired. Process all the events and actions that have happened since the event fired.
 * AuraInspector:OnTransactionEnd               Transaction has ended and should now be added to the UI.
 * AuraInspector:UpdatedStorageData             Aura Storage Service has async fetched data to show in the storage panel.
 * AuraInspector:RemoveStorageData              Remove stored response for the action we would like to drop next time we see it
 * AuraInspector:ShowComponentInTree            Indicates you want to show the specified globalID in the component tree.
 * AuraInspector:OnClientActionStart            We started executing the handler for a controller action.
 * AuraInspector:OnClientActionEnd              Controller Action finished execution.
 * AuraInspector:OnDescriptorSelect             A descriptor was clicked on, we may want to take some action here such as showing a panel that has more information.
 * AuraInspector:OnInjectionScriptInitialized   The AuraInspectorInjectionScript has been injected and initialized. (Usable by external plugins to know when they can wire into the script on the hosted page.)
 * AuraInspector:OnActionStateChange            When an action is enqueued, fired, running we fire this message with the current status of the action. Includes just changed data on the action that we care about.
 * AuraInspector:ShowLoading                    Show the Loading indicator in the Lightning Inspector Panel. (The parameter passed to the ShowLoading is used as a trace key. Use it for Show and Hide so we know what to stop tracking.)
 * AuraInspector:hideLoading                    Hide the Loading indicator for the Lightning Inspector Panel
 * AuraInspector:OnError                        An Error occured somewhere. First parameter is the error message.

 // ChaosManager stuff, move to SfdcInspector:
 * AuraInspector:OnStartChaosRun                User has click button "Start Chaos Run" in chaos tab, let's start randomly clicking through the app
 * AuraInspector:OnStopChaosRun                 User has click button "Stop the Run", we are done with current new chaos run
 * AuraInspector:OnSaveChaosRun                 User has click button "Save the Run", we will save the chaos run into local file
 * AuraInspector:OnLoadChaosRun                 User has load a chaos run from local file
 * AuraInspector:OnReplayChaosRun               User has click button "Replay Chaos Run", let's start replaying
 * AuraInspector:OnContinueChaosRun             We might need to refresh during a replay, this will continue the ongoing replay.
 * AuraInspector:OnStopAllChaosRun              User has click the panic button, let's stop all chaos run, and clear up everything
 * AuraInspector:OnSomeActionGetDropped         We just drop some action during a replay
